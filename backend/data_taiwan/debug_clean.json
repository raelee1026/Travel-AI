        "content": "Linkou Winery is a new winery formed from the merger of Taipei Winery (1921), Banqiao Winery (1937), and Shulin Winery (1906) with nearly a century of history. It officially started mass production in the spring of 1976. The three former wineries each had different products and cultural characteristics. After the merger, they developed into the rice grain wine production factory with the largest production capacity and the most modern equipment in the northern region. Linkou Winery has been mainly engaged in the production of Shaoxing wine since its establishment. In 1985, it used the original Shaoxing wine production equipment to brew Japanese sake and successfully launched \"Yuquan Sake\". It is the only winery in the country that produces Japanese sake. In 1993, in order to solve the problem of sake meal by-products, the \"Taiwan sake sake meal mask\" product was developed. It was positioned as a natural skin care material. It was so popular that it was called \"the poor man's SKII\". In 1994, the company launched innovative research and development, combining Eastern red yeast rice and Western wine, and launched \"Yuquan red yeast wine\" with a health concept and suitable for Taiwanese tastes. It has been deeply loved by the public and is the wine brand with the highest market share in Taiwan. Linkou Winery is not only committed to the research and development of various wines, but its production methods have also become more diversified. In 1996, the company collaborated with a major biscuit manufacturer to develop \"Taiwanese Wine Red Yeast Healthy Pancakes\". The unique flavor caused a rush and became popular at home and abroad. In just one and a half years, it created a turnover of more than 1 billion yuan, becoming a miracle in the biscuit industry. In order to diversify the business, in addition to wine production, an exhibition and sales center has been set up, including a \"sake restaurant\", \"red rice wine hall\", \"liquor bank\" and other process exhibition halls, which are open to the public or foreign tourists. On the one hand, visitors can understand the process and history of wine making, and on the other hand, it also promotes the development of Linkou Winery. It is connected with other attractions in the industrial zone (such as the Formosa Plastics Museum, Zhulin Temple, Formosa Medical Park, Huaya Science and Technology Park, etc.) and the nearby Yingge Town industries to form a local industrial cultural tourism theme. In addition to driving industrial tourism, it also enhances the richness of Taoyuan County's tourism system. In order to cooperate with the company's asset revitalization policy, and in conjunction with Taoyuan County's promotion of the aviation city plan and the opening of the airport MRT line, Linkou Winery integrates the basis of wine production, industrial history, market location, etc., and combines industrial culture, creative arts, humanities and other resources to shape The factory will be transformed into a park to create a sake-image cultural park, connecting the surrounding city outlines, places of interest, attractions and public facilities, and building it into an iconic tourist brewery in the northern region. It is expected to attract 8 million people in northern Taiwan to come to the factory for sightseeing and recreation, thereby increasing revenue.",
